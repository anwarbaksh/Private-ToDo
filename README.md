# Private-ToDo
Private todo list that uses web storage.

I needed a simple todo app and I wanted to experiment with Web Storage.

It is built from a todo list tutorial and example provided by W3Schools.com

I added several key JavaScript functions to handle CRUD operations for the list items.

This app allows you to add task, records date of creation and presents number of days from creation (outstanding days) of each task. 
It allows checking off tasks as complete and hiding tasks from list. 
All tasks are stored permanently as long as the browser storage is not deleted manually or from some other mechanism.

I'm considering adding new features for version 2. Specifically adding cloud backup storage and local file storage backup.

This app is free to use, copy, and modify as needed.
